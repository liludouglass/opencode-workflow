# Long-Form Post Generator

Transform the following idea into an engaging, value-packed long-form post:

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Take this idea and craft a single long-form post that educates, engages, and delivers massive value. Every paragraph should earn the next scroll.

## The Four Pillars of Posts That Actually Work

### 1. It Needs to Be Genuinely Valuable

You can't just regurgitate advice that's been floating around for years.

The same recycled tips said a thousand times won't make anyone stop scrolling.

Dig into your experience and pull out insights that are fresh. Things that haven't been beaten to death across the platform. Ideas that could genuinely shift how someone approaches their work or thinks about their business.

The difference between content that gets ignored and content that gets saved is whether you're saying something new—or at least saying something old in a way that makes people see it differently.

Ask yourself before posting: would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it? If the answer is no, keep working on it.

### 2. It Needs to Be Immediately Actionable

An insight without a blueprint is basically entertainment, not education.

Don't just point at something and say "this is insane." That brings in almost no followers and zero business opportunities.

People don't follow you because you noticed something. They follow you because you taught them how to use it.

Walk through the actual process. Step by step, line by line, exactly how to implement it.

People will read the entire thing because you're not just giving them information—you're giving them a system.

Do this consistently and some percentage of your followers will want to hire you because they've already seen proof you know what you're talking about.

The posts become your portfolio.

### 3. It Needs to Spark Natural Engagement

Don't beg for engagement. "Like if you agree" just makes you look desperate.

Structure your post so replies and bookmarks happen naturally:

**For bookmarks:** Use phrases like "here's how" or "how to" or "do this" in your hook. People on autopilot see something useful, bookmark it for later, keep scrolling. Make that first line so clear and valuable the bookmark happens instinctively.

**For replies, two approaches:**

- Push your opinion harder, take a controversial stance. People will either argue or back you up. Either way, engagement.

- Keep it slightly open, invite perspective. "This is what I'm using right now, curious if anyone's tested a different approach." Feels collaborative. People love sharing their experiences when you give them an opening.

### 4. It Needs to Be Ridiculously Easy to Read

Most people scroll at insane speeds. Their eyes land on your post for maybe one second before deciding whether to engage.

If your structure looks messy or your opening looks like a wall of text, they're already gone.

**Structure rules:**

- Hook needs to be short and punchy. One line that signals what value you're about to deliver.
- One sentence per line whenever possible. Creates natural rhythm.
- Use lists with "-" to organize complex information into digestible pieces.
- White space matters. Space between lines gives eyes a place to rest. Solid blocks of text feel exhausting before you even start reading.

**Language rules:**

- Simplify everything. Conversational tone like you're a mentor talking to students.
- Use "use" instead of "utilize"
- Say "help" instead of "facilitate"  
- Write "get better" instead of "optimize performance"
- If your 14-year-old cousin couldn't understand it, it's too complex. Dumb it down until it feels almost too simple, then stop there.

## Develop Your Recognizable Style

Same hooks, same structure, same voice—it all blends into generic AI-sounding content soup.

When someone has a writing style you can identify instantly, you stop scrolling completely.

Your style is what makes people remember you:

- Maybe you always structure breakdowns a certain way
- Maybe you start most posts with a specific pattern
- Maybe you write in fragments sometimes. For emphasis.
- Maybe you use "tbh" or "honestly" before controversial takes

Find 3-4 structural elements that feel natural and use them frequently. But mix up the order, change the context. Your style should feel like you, not like you're filling in a template.

## The Payoff

When you nail this consistently:

- People stop scrolling when they see your name
- Your posts pull people to your profile because every single one delivers clear insights with actionable steps
- When you're ready to sell, conversion becomes natural—you've been proving your expertise in public for months
- They've already experienced your teaching style. Hiring you just feels like the logical next step.

## Output Format

Present the post as a single, clean block of text ready to copy-paste. No blockquote formatting in the output—just clean text with line breaks.

After the post, provide:
- **Character count**
- **One-line summary** (the core insight)
- **Best pull quote** (which line works as a standalone tweet)

Now transform the input into a high-value long-form post.
