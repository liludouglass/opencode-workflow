# Viral Tweet Generator

Transform the following thought or opinion into a viral tweet:

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

Take this raw thought/opinion and craft a tweet that will resonate deeply with people and have viral potential.

## Viral Tweet Principles

1. **Hook in the first line** - Stop the scroll. The opening must be impossible to ignore.
2. **Emotional resonance** - Tap into universal feelings: ambition, frustration, hope, surprise
3. **Contrarian or unexpected angle** - Challenge conventional wisdom or reveal a hidden truth
4. **Specificity beats generic** - Concrete details > vague statements
5. **Leave something unsaid** - Create curiosity, make them think
6. **Rhythm and pacing** - Short punchy sentences. Then a longer one for contrast.
7. **No hashtags, no emojis** - Let the words do the work

## Tweet Formats That Work

- **The counterintuitive truth**: "Most people think X. But actually Y."
- **The hard-won lesson**: "I spent [time] learning [thing]. Here's what nobody tells you:"
- **The reframe**: Take a common belief and flip it
- **The observation**: Notice something everyone experiences but nobody talks about
- **The permission slip**: Give people permission to do/think something they secretly want

## Output Requirements

Generate 3 tweet versions, each with a different approach:

### Version 1: The Hook
Maximum impact opening line. Make them stop scrolling.

### Version 2: The Story
Add a human element or personal angle that makes it relatable.

### Version 3: The Contrarian
Challenge assumptions. Say what others are afraid to say.

## Rules

- Stay under 280 characters per tweet
- No corporate speak or buzzwords
- Sound like a human, not a brand
- If the thought is weak, strengthen the idea first, then write the tweet
- Be bold. Safe tweets don't go viral.

Now transform the input into 3 viral tweet versions. Present each clearly with its character count.
