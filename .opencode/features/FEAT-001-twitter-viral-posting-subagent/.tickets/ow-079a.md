# Create twitter-writing-techniques.md skill file

Create comprehensive skill file at ~/.config/opencode/skill/twitter-writing-techniques.md containing:\n\nSection 1: Full Tutorial #2 Content - "How to Tweet"\n- Fundamental approach: "post a shit ton of high-value content every single day"\n- The insight-to-tweet gap: "brilliant insight doesn't automatically turn into a great tweet"\n- Value requirement: Must be genuinely valuable\n  - Fresh insights, not recycled advice\n  - "Would I bookmark this?" test\n- Actionability requirement: Must be immediately actionable\n  - Blueprint, step-by-step approach\n  - Tweets become portfolio\n- Natural engagement triggers:\n  - Bookmarks via "here's how", "how to", "do this"\n  - Replies via controversial stance OR open-ended invitations\n- The anti-pattern: "begging for engagement makes you look desperate"\n\nSection 2: Readability Framework\n- One sentence per line for maximum readability\n- Lists using "-" or ">" or "1."\n- White space matters - don't wall-of-text\n- Simplify everything, conversational tone\n- The 14-year-old cousin test: "if your 14-year-old cousin couldn't understand your tweet, it's probably too complex"\n\nSection 3: Style Development Framework\n- Patterns that become signature\n- Consistency without being formulaic\n- 3-4 structural elements, mix up the order\n- Build audience that respects your ideas, not just follower count\n- The hiring outcome: "hiring you just feels like the logical next step"\n\nSection 4: Common Mistakes to Avoid\n- Burying the lead: Don't make readers hunt for the value\n- Being too humble: "This might help" sounds weak\n- Overcomplicating: Simple wins over clever\n- Forgetting the reader: Focus on their needs, not your knowledge\n- Weak endings: End with impact, not fade-outs\n\nSection 5: Viral Quote Examples with Analysis\n- Quote: "The bar is truly so low. For everything. So much of the world is run by confident but mediocre people just trundling along. You can simply show up, act like you belong, put in the work & win in any category you want to. These people are not smarter than you."\n- Analysis of why it works:\n  - Confident claim that challenges status quo\n  - Relatable frustration with mediocre people\n  - Actionable conclusion: "show up, act like you belong, put in the work"\n  - Confidence without arrogance\n  - Empowers the reader\n- Additional quote examples from approach.md with analysis\n\nSection 6: The "Would I Bookmark This?" Test\n- Checklist for genuine value\n- Fresh perspective verification\n- Actionability verification\n- Reader benefit verification
