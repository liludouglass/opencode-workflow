# Create twitter-copywriting-principles.md skill file

Create comprehensive skill file at ~/.config/opencode/skill/twitter-copywriting-principles.md containing:\n\nPart 1: 20 Writing Principles (from writing_principles_context.txt)\nEach principle must include:\n- Description with Twitter-specific application\n- How to apply in 280 characters or less\n- Common mistakes to avoid\n- Examples and non-examples\n\nPrinciples list:\n1. Have Something Worth Saying - strong idea over perfect grammar\n2. Know the Audience - understand their problems, read comments\n3. Define the Purpose - inform, persuade, entertain, sell\n4. Write Conversationally - contractions, questions, "you" language\n5. Keep it Simple - fewer sharper sentences, frictionless transfer\n6. Open Strong - start with curiosity, value, or surprise\n7. Use Active Voice - subject verb object structure\n8. One Idea per Unit - one idea per sentence, one topic per paragraph\n9. Format for Skimmers - short paragraphs, bullets, white space\n10. Be Concrete - specific over abstract, paint clear picture\n11. Use Stories & Emotion - facts inform, stories stick\n12. Show, Don't Just Tell - "she slammed the door" > "she was angry"\n13. Structure for Clarity - tell them what you'll say, say it, recap\n14. Vary Sentence Length - rhythm keeps readers engaged\n15. Use Transitions - breadcrumbs guide the reader\n16. Cut Ruthlessly - delete fluff, replace weak words\n17. Read It Out Loud - listen for awkward flow\n18. Write for the Reader - think about their needs\n19. Write with Confidence - skip disclaimers, own it\n20. Finish Strong - end with punch, summarize, challenge\n\nPart 2: 12 Twitter Copywriting Categories (from twitter_copy_principles.md)\n\n1. Hook Fundamentals\n- Target reader directly: "You can make k" > "Web designers make k"\n- Lead with benefit first\n- Avoid overused patterns ("Most creators...", "Everyone is doing...")\n- Start with strong claims (big numbers, surprising insights, bold statements)\n\n2. Content Structure\n- One clear idea per tweet\n- Use bullet points for readability\n- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max)\n- End with clear CTA\n\n3. Engagement Triggers\n- Social proof: "K made", "100k followers"\n- Urgency/Scarcity: "Free for 24hrs", "Must be following"\n- Low friction: "No email bs", "Just comment X"\n- Exclusive access: "I'll DM you the full guide"\n\n4. Voice and Tone\n- Write conversationally like talking to a friend\n- Use contractions (I'll, won't, can't)\n- Be direct, skip fluff words\n- Show confidence, avoid disclaimers\n- Casual but valuable, non-salesy\n\n5. Psychological Triggers\n- Pain point first\n- Problem → Solution\n- Specific numbers beat vague claims\n- Time-bound results ("in 90 days")\n\n6. Format for Skimmers\n- Visual breaks (line breaks, bullets, emojis)\n- Scannable structure (key points stand out)\n- White space (don't wall-of-text)\n- Numbered lists for steps/features\n\n7. Power Words and Phrases\n- Action verbs: built, cracked, scraped, automated\n- Outcome language: instantly, automatically, on autopilot\n- Exclusivity: hidden, secret, exact system\n- Urgency: now, today, before it's too late\n\n8. CTA Formula\n- Step 1: Clear action (Comment, Follow, Like)\n- Step 2: Specific trigger (Comment 'REDDIT')\n- Step 3: Benefit reminder (and I'll DM the full guide)\n- Step 4: Requirements (must be following)\n\n9. Content Angles\n- Behind-the-scenes: "Here's my exact workflow..."\n- Case studies: "This client made  using..."\n- Tool breakdowns: "I built a system that..."\n- Reverse engineering: "I analyzed 20 viral posts..."\n- Problem/solution: "Stop doing X, do Y instead"\n\n10. Editing Principles\n- Read aloud: if it sounds wrong, it reads wrong\n- Cut ruthlessly: delete unnecessary words\n- Strengthen weak phrases: replace vague with specific\n- Vary sentence length: mix short punchy with longer explanatory\n- Check clarity: would a stranger understand this?\n\n11. Advanced Techniques\n- Pattern interrupts: break expected formats\n- Curiosity gaps: "The results will shock you"\n- Storytelling: brief narratives that illustrate points\n- Contrarian takes: challenge conventional wisdom\n- Stacking benefits: layer multiple value propositions\n\n12. Testing and Iteration\n- Track what works: note which hooks get engagement\n- A/B test formats: try different structures\n- Study your winners: reverse engineer best posts\n- Adapt successful patterns: reuse frameworks that work\n- Stay current: watch for market fatigue on overused phrases\n\nPart 3: Editing Checklist\n- Check each principle against generated content\n- Verify all copywriting categories applied\n- Twitter-specific adaptations verified
