# Add test scripts for integration phase

## Description

npm run type-check, lint, test, and build fail because the scripts are missing in package.json. This blocks Phase 5 integration verification.

## Expected

Define test suite scripts (or documented alternatives) so integration can execute type-check, lint, tests, and build without errors.

## Actual

npm reports missing scripts and exits with an error for each command.
